**A powerful and intuitive PaperMC plugin to control minecart speeds using configurable track blocks.**

SpeedTracks allows you to design railway systems with dynamic speeds. By simply changing the block under a rail, you can create high-speed express lines, slow scenic routes, or special functional tracks. The system is managed through a clean and easy-to-use configuration file.

## Features

-   **üöÄ Intuitive Speed Multipliers:** Configure speeds in a user-friendly way. `1.0` is normal speed, `2.0` is double speed, `0.5` is half speed.
-   **‚úÖ Simple by Design:** No complex setup. Place a block, put a rail on it, and watch your minecarts adjust their speed automatically.
-   **‚ö° High Performance:** Built for the Paper API to be lightweight with minimal impact on server performance.
-   **‚ÑπÔ∏è Informative Commands:** Use `/st info` to view all custom speed blocks or check the multiplier for a specific block.
-   **üîÑ Live Reloading:** Update your configuration on the fly with the `/st reload` command. No server restart needed.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/basiszock/SpeedTracks/releases).
2.  Place the `SpeedTracks-X.X.X.jar` file into your **Paper 1.21+** server's `plugins/` directory.
3.  Start your server. The default configuration file will be generated at `plugins/SpeedTracks/config.yml`.

## Configuration (`config.yml`)

The configuration is designed to be as simple as possible.

```yaml
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #
#                  Configuration for SpeedTracks                     #
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# Define custom speed multipliers for minecarts based on the block
# directly beneath the rail.
#
# The value is a multiplier of Minecraft's default minecart speed.
# 1.0 = Default speed (100%)
# 2.0 = Double speed (200%)
# 0.5 = Half speed (50%)
# 0.0 = Stops the minecart
speed-blocks:
  # Examples for faster travel
  GOLD_BLOCK: 2.0
  DIAMOND_BLOCK: 3.0
  EMERALD_BLOCK: 4.0
  NETHERITE_BLOCK: 6.0

  # Examples for slower travel
  SOUL_SAND: 0.5
  SLIME_BLOCK: 0.25

  # Example for a full stop
  OBSIDIAN: 0.0
```
